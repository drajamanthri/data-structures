<h1>Convert binary tree to graph (Depth First Search)</h1>
Purposes of converting a binary tree to graph.
<ul>
    <li>Allows start traversal from any node</li>
    <li>In binary tree, parent can access children. But children can not access parent. With graph, traversal can be done towards any direction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Complexity</h2>
Similar to binary tree dfs, both time and space complexity is O(n).
