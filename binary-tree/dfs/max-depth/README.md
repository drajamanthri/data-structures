<h1>Binary Tree- Max depth</h1>
If the root is null (initial depth), max depth = -1<br>
For each additional level, depth is incremented by 1<br>
If the tree has only the root, max depth = 0 and so on<br>
<h2>Complexity</h2>
n= number of nodes<br>
Complexities are usually given for the worst case. Therefore the following complexities are for the worst case.<br>
<p>
Time complexity = O(n)
</p>
<p>
Space complexity = O(n)
