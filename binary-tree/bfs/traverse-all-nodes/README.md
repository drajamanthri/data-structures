<h1>Binary Tree- Breadth First Search</h1>
The breadth first search algorithm is implemented by using a queue.

<br>
Following time and space complexities are given for the worst case.

<h2>Time complexity</h2>
n = number of nodes<br>
Time complexity = O(n)

<h2>Space complexity</h2>

Space complexity = O(L)<br>
L is the number of nodes of the layer which has the most nodes.
