<h1>Two Pointer</h1>
<h2>Same array opposite ends</h2>
<p>
Properties
<ul>
<li>
Two pointers can be used to traverse an array starting from the opposite ends. 
</li>
<li>
At each iteration, one or both pointers move towards each other.
</li>
<li>
Pointer move logic depends on the problem.
</li>
<li>
The traversal stops when two pointers stops. 
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Time complexity</h2>
<p>
Time complexity = O(n)
<br>
If the complexity of each iteration is O(1)
</p>
<h2>Space complexity</h2>
<p>
Space complexity = O(1)
<br>
Space taken by two pointers is a constant.
