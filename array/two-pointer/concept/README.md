<h1>Two Pointer</h1>
<h2>Same array opposite ends</h2>
<p>
Two pointers can be used to traverse an array starting from the opposite ends. The traversal stops when two pointers stops. 
</p>
<h2>Time complexity</h2>
<p>
Time complexity = O(n)
<br>
If the complexity of each iteration is O(1)
</p>
<h2>Space complexity</h2>
<p>
Space complexity = O(1)
<br>
Space taken by two pointers is a constant.
